# Labyrinth game

The game that will be implemented for this project is a two player labyrinth, displayed on a 16x16 led matrix. Each player controls his character with a joystick and tries to reach the exit of the maze while avoiding the mines faster that the other player. The mazes will be randomly generated.

Reasons why this project meets all the technical requirements:
- Uses not one, but four matrixes, each controlled with a MAX7219 driver
- Has an LCD display for showing the progress and the score of each player
- The players control their characters with joysticks
