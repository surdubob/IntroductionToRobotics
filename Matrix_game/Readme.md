# Labyrinth game

The game that will be implemented for this project is a labyrinth, displayed on a 8x8 led matrix. The player controls his character with a joystick and tries to reach the exit of the maze while avoiding the monsters. The mazes are randomly generated.

Reasons why this project meets all the technical requirements:
- Uses an 8x8 led matrix controlled with the MAX2719 driver
- Has an LCD display for showing the progress and the score of each player
- The player controls his character with a joystick
