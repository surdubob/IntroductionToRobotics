# Labyrinth game

The game that will be implemented for this project is a randomly generated labyrinth, displayed on a 8x8 led matrix. The player controls his character with a joystick and has to find the diamonds and reach the exit of the maze.

### Used hardware components:

1. Power up the system
2. - If you want to start the game directly, from level 1, just press the joystick's button.
